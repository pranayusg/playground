1 UI (Understand the Angular Project structure,various files and  what it does,Angular CLI)

So till now I have explored about 

2 Components,Modules, Decorators @Component , Binding  - Interpolation,Property Binding,Event Binding,2 way binding [(ngModel)]  ,Structural Directives *ngIf, *ngFor ,bootstrap applied

2 way binding [(ngModel)]
Getter and setters functions
template to component

Event Binding, Show Image,2 way binding [(ngModel)]
Pipes,Custome Pipes (Transform data before showing in UI)
Improving Components - 
		Interface- As a type and Feature set , class implements interface
		StyleUrls

Lifecycle Hooks-ngOnInit,ngOnChange,ngOnDestroy
Nested Components


Services,Dependency Injection(Use constructors to inject dependency)
RxJs,observables ,subsribe , unsubscribe


Next is Angular Modules
More on RxJs and observables

1 Restructre Project with individual modules(App Module,Feature Module ,Shared Module)

RXJS
2 using Subject and takeuntil to unsubscribe

ROUTING

Routing and navigation
Configure routes (app module)

Invoke from navigation
app html nav  </router-outlet> where we want the component to be displayed

If we want to invoke route from code then we use [routerLink] and navigate back

Passing Parameters in routes and accessing them
Guards
	
3 Pass object between components 
	Through query params,Through route state,through Required Route params in url
	Parent to child ,Child to parent (star component)

4 Prefetching data using Resolvers (Product details page)
  If correct id is passed ,rseolvers will run 1st and then page will be loaded with small delay but with fetched data
  If string is passed Route guards will get activated
  If BE returned error ,then error handling will be shown on the page
5 Lazy Loading
	File bundles are downloaded only when we need it and not everytime ,to speedup initial start time
	Prerequisites - Declare Components in module, Specify path as parent and children,Remove Products module from App Mod
   

FORMS (Angular Reactive Forms by Deborah Kurata)

Template-driven Form

Reactive form
Module imports,-ReactiveFormsModule
Formconcontrol,
formbuilder,
populateTestData setValue(To set all values),patchValue(To set partial form values) -(populateTestData)


Validators
built in validators,
adjusting Validators at run time (Send notification) (click)="setNotification(email)" on form but chnaged to Watching and Reacting to changes (Phone)
Custom validators (ratingRange)
Cross Field validator (emailMatcher)

Watch and Reacting to changes
Adjusting Validation-(ngOnInit setNotification) valueChanges property and then subscribe
Displaying Validation Messages- (check where emailMessage is used)
Reactive Transformation (Debounce time)- Show validation message only after 1000 millisec has passed

Dynamically Duplicate Input elements
Search adrresses and check
Form Array

Add and Edit Product
Add route configuration
CanDeactivate Guard- When navgating away from route after changing values
Move validator in a separate file -class

CRUD 
API

Accordion table
